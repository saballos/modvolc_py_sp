# modvolc_py_sp
This is a python script for thermal anomalies extraction for a single point of interest.
This script is able to download, visualize, compute some basic counting of thermal anomalies and produce CSV format output files for MODIS sensor data processed with the MODVOLC algorithm using the Normalized Thermal Index (NTI) developed by Wright et al. (2002). Automated volcanic eruption detection using MODIS. Remote sensing of environment, 82(1), 135-155.
